	<h1> Drink before the war</h1>

 <!--Paste your lyrics below -->
<p> Well, you tell us that we're wrong
And you tell us not to sing our song
Nothing we can say will make you see
You got a heart of stone, you can never feel
You say, "Oh, I'm not afraid, it can't happen to me
I've lived my life as a good man
Oh no, you're out of your mind, it won't happen to me
'Cause I've carried my weight and I've been a strong man", yeah-yeah
But listen to the man in the liquor store
Yelling, "Anybody want a drink before the war?"
And your parents paid you through
You got a nice big car, nothing bothers you
Somebody cut out your eyes, you refuse to see
Ah, somebody cut out your heart, you refuse to feel
And you live in a shell
You create your own hell
You live in the past and talk about war
And you dig your own grave, yeah
But it's a life you can save
So stop getting fussed, it's not gonna happen
And you'll cry but you'll never fall, no, no, no
You're building a wall
Gotta break it down, start again
No, no, no, it won't happen to us
We've lived our lives
Basically we've been good men
So stop talking of war
'Cause you know we've heard it all before
Why don't you go out there
And do something useful
Oh, listen to the man in the liquor store
He yelling, "Anybody wanna drink before the war?"
"Anybody wanna drink before the war?"
"Anybody wanna drink before the war?" </p>
