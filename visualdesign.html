You can create collage on google slides using images from online or you can create a collage using magazine paper.This was a vision board for my new years revolution.

<p>For this project I followed the steps to make my own Bitmoji Person that looks like me and has accessories that represent my life! I used SnapChat to recreate this. I like to bake so I made my bitmoji a chef and we can see how shes baking something. My favorite food is pizza üçï, so I made my bitmoji be next to a heart pizza representing the love I have for it lol. People say I get mad easily so we can see my bitmoji huffing due to her being angry. Lastly I am fascinated with learning new things and becoming the bes version of my self. My bitmojis represent me;)&nbsp;</p>
