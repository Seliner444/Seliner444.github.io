<h1>All about Meüíê</h1>

	<h1> My future;)</h1>
	
<p>What I would love to do in the future is to become a Pediatrician üë©üèΩ‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èand be as successful and be independent. For this to happen I would need to earn a doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or a doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) from a medical school. Than and admission to medical school requires a bachelor's degree, MCAT scores, and sufficient undergraduate science coursework. My dream college is NYU and I would want to major in pre-med and minor in business. I've always dreamed on becoming a pediatrician due to my love for kids and wanting to help them and care for them. Some other careers I have in mind are Dentistry more specifically Orthodontist or OBGYNs. I am excited to attend college and expirence the college life lol and get to meet new friends and learn. Very excited to see what the future holds for me. </p>

<h1>My iconüåü</h1>
<p>My love for Lana Del Rey started last year when I heard "Cinnamon Girl" from her NFR! album. I listen to her whenever I need to feel relaxed and calm. Her soothing voice clams me and her beautiful lyrics make me so happy. Her cinematic music videos are master peices and I just think everyone should love her. Lana Del Rey aka Elizabeth Woolridge Grant, was born june 21, 1985 making her a cancer ‚ôãÔ∏è like me. Lana has won many grammy awrads for her music videos. My favorite album is Ultraviolnce, Born to Die, and Born to Die: Paradise Edition but all her albums are top 10. My current favorite song is "Chemtrails over the Country Club" and "How to Disapear". I Recommend everyone to listen to this queen and love her just like i do lol;)</p>
